For the majority of my life, I have only attended large public schools and those years were the biggest struggle for me. I remember dreading each and every morning going to school, I hated it so much with a burning passion. I had teachers I didn’t fully get along with, teachers that always told me I was in danger of failing the class, and teachers who just never genuinely cared for their students. The kids were no better than the teachers, they were rude and called me by offensive names whenever they had the chance. I was always the very shy and quiet individual, who was never able to defend herself and was not able to show her true colors to the world, constantly in fear of being judged. Having to follow the same routine each and every single day became extremely boring and managed to kill my entire elementary and middle school experience.The moment I applied to Da Vinci Communications and got accepted, I was so happy. I learned that the teachers never gave up on their students, no matter how stubborn and ignorant they were in class. They became determined to make the student pass with an A and if the goal was not met they tried very hard for the student to pass at least with a C. Knowing the public school systems and the teachers working there, they would have simply let the student fail and blamed the student for not trying. They did not  let students have the extra opportunity of redoing the assignment, unlike at DVC. They care way more about the mastery of the content, rather than simply playing a game of memorization in each class. I’ve witnessed the amount of effort they put into helping students struggling in school no matter what the situation is, I am able to see how compassionate each teacher is, helping the students out, and giving them resources if needed. Attending DVC has given me a sense of hope that I never received during my time in those public schools; seeing how going to DVC has made my education much more valuable. This school has taught me to be myself and helped me in subjects that I struggled in as a child for the longest time. Giving me the opportunity to retake tests and actually learn the content and understand why I got the answers incorrect and yes, sometimes it can be stressful, but in the end, it all pays off. I am getting the education I deserve and someday in the future, all this will pay off. I will continue working hard until I reach the pinnacle of my life and when I am truly happy with myself. Which is why I simply just want to say thank you to all the teachers at DVC, who gave me the motivation to continue after I doubted myself, who helped me through my hardest time, who believed in me when I didn’t believe in myself, and for those who put so much effort into teaching us something meaningful each day.
